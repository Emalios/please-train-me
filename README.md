# Please Train Me

This project is an update of the [old version](https://github.com/Emalios/PleaseTrainMe) that I made in java, I intend to go further in the implementation of this 
genetic algorithm and to allow to configure some input information.

## Milestones

Here is a list of features already implemented or not:

- [ ] Functional genetic algorithm.
- [ ] Reset and pause buttons.
- [ ] Wall implementation.
- [ ] GUI for configuration of many parameters like the number of cells or the number of iterations.
- [ ] Saving the evolution at an instant t in order to resume it later.
